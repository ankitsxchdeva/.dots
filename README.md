Mac Setup
1. Brew installation - /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
2. Brew install zoom, firefox, karabiner-elements, tmux, python, spotify, gnu-util, grip, discord, etc.
3. Copy zshrc, vimrc, and tmux files from GitHub, add .hushlogin
4. Install [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) and [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) in a new directory called .zsh_plugins
5. Change mouse scroll to a sane setting
6. Copy karabiner-elements conf
7. Menu bar -> auto hide, dock -> smallest size and auto hide
8. magnet setup from app store (no homebrew so manual installation for these)

I should eventually write a script to do most of this
